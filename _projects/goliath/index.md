title: Goliath (2025)
description:  Goliath is a beast of a machine. Specialized for machine learning training and high performance computing, I built it from the ground up for training computer vision models and running local LLMs and VLMs. It boasts an industry standard server-grade Supermicro motherboard with an AMD EPYC 7052 32-core / 64-thread CPU, 256 GB of ECC DDR4 RAM, 5 TB of high speed NVME M.2 SSD storage, and an NVIDIA 3090 graphics card with 24GB of VRAM. Goliath can output a lot of heat and noise, so to keep it cool at quiet volumes I installed 4x 140mm inlet fans, 1x 140mm exhaust fan, and an AIO liquid cooler + radiator with 3x 120mm exhaust fans. It runs Ubuntu 24 and Windows 11 Pro and can be accessed remotely via remote desktop and a custom discord bot. It runs models like llama3, gemma3, gpt-oss, etc. usually hitting ~ >= 30 tokens/second in Ollama. From conception to final installations this project took about 3 months. The main delay was sourcing a GPU within my budget in the middle of the Nvidia 50 series launch window / tarrifs.
